                        <h3>animatronic arm</h3>
                        <p>The control system reads the programmed instructions and communicates them to the actuators. The actuators then move the joints, causing the robotic arm to perform the desired motion. Sensors provide feedback about the arm's position, forces involved, and surroundings</p>

                        <h3>Digital Twin</h3>
                        <p>A digital twin is a virtual, data-rich model of a physical product, process, or system that is continuously updated with real-time information from its real-world counterpart via sensors and other devices. This synchronized digital replica allows for monitoring, analysis, simulation, and prediction of performance without impacting the physical asset, leading to improved efficiency, faster development, minimized failure rates, and innovative new business opportunities</p>
